# Neuroimaging-with-R

#### [By Joon Hwan Hong](https://github.com/Joon-Hwan-Hong)

## Introduction

From the public dataset from John Hopkins University, this project contain code that does the following:

1. Binary masking
2. Backmapping
3. Bias field correction
4. Linear transformation

of MRI images in NifTI and DICOM format. The R scripts process and generate visualizations, graphs, etc.  
**Note**: some code uses FSLR, an FSL software wrapper for R, which needs to be installed for any use.

## Examples:
